        Jude Kharchou is a Chechen-Syrian artist working with moving image and
        performance art to explore cultural memory, displacement, and connection
        to land. Their practice moves between digital and physical spaces, using
        film, video installation, stop-motion animation, creative coding, and
        print-based processes to document and reimagine histories and cultural
        practices. Through ephemeral and lasting forms of storytelling, they
        consider the body as both an archive and a site of grief, memory, and
        continuity.
